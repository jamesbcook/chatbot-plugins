# Read Link Plugins

This is a extra plugin and does not have a command, or populate the help menu.

## Read Link

This plugin will read each text message that it has access to and attempt to determine if a URL is present in the text. If a URL is found, chatbot will attempt to find the title of the link and post it back to the chat.
